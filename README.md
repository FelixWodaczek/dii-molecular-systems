# Differentiable Information Imbalance in Molecular Systems
Source code of data pipelines "(Automatic feature selection and weighting in molecular systems using Differentiable Information Imbalance)[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.00851]".

## Installation

Ideally, create a separate `conda` environment to run these notebooks in.
```bash
conda env create dii_ms -f environment.yml
```

Alternatively, install the dependencies listed in the `environment.yml` using the environment manager of your choice (eg. `pip`).

## Source Data

All source data is located in an (OSF Repository)[].
Download it and add the contained data to the individual directories.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add add DOI of OSF above
- [ ] Remove old files from water_phases and check if imports work correctly
- [ ] in final iteration add compiled versions of all jupyter notebooks
